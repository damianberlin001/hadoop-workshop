# NoSQL Platform on Docker

## Provisioning environment
The environment for this course is completly based on docker containers. 

In order to simplify the provisioning, a single docker-compose configuration is used. All the necessary software will be provisioned using Docker. 

You have the follwing options to start the environment:

 * [**Local Virtual Machine Environment**](./LocalVirtualMachine.md) - a Virtual Machine with Docker and Docker Compose pre-installed will be distributed at by the course instructure. You will need 50 GB free disk space.
 * [**Local Docker Enironment**](./LocalDocker.md) - you have a local Docker and Docker Compose setup in place which you want to use
 * [**AWS Lightsail Environment**](./Lightsail.md) - AWS Lightsail is a service in Amazon Web Services (AWS) with which we can easily startup a environment and provide all the necessary bootstraping as a script.


## Post Provisioning

These steps are necessary after the starting the docker environment. 

### Add entry to local /etc/hosts File
To simplify working with the Analytics Platform and for the links below to work, add the following entry to your local `/etc/hosts` file. 

```
40.91.195.92	analyticsplatform
```

Replace the IP address by the PUBLIC IP of the docker host.
